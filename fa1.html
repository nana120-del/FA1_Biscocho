	      <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
	      <p>My workday usually starts way before the sun comes up,‚ÄúDing ding ding!‚Äù is the sound my alarm makes at 3:00 am for those early flights. I grab already made breakfast from 7:11, and prepare my suitcase for the day. Then I style my hair, do my makeup and put on my uniform, a neat hat, and stylish but slightly uncomfortable shoes. Well, it's comfortable for a while until I wear them for 7 hours. Before leaving the house, I make sure I have my passport, my worktablet, and my bag filled with essentials.</p>
	      <p>At the airport, well.. It's definitely something, but I‚Äôd called it (maybe) organized chaos. I meet my captain and the rest of my cabin crew for a quick meeting before the flight. We go over who‚Äôs on the flight, if anyone needs special help like special food because of allergies, and all the safety stuff. Today, we‚Äôre off to Paris, so it‚Äôs a long one!</p>

	    <section id="midday">
	      <h2>Midday Tasks & Projects</h2>
	      <p>For my job, I can be anything! From safety, security, bartending, and service, I‚Äôve got it all covered. Safety is always number one though. Before anyone even boards, we do checks like making sure the emergency gears are where they should be, and that the doors are ready to be armed for takeoff.</p>
	      <p>Once we‚Äôre flying, now it‚Äôs time for service! This is where I work closely with my crew boss or my Pursur and all the other flight attendants. On a long flight like this, serving meals and drinks may look simple, but it‚Äôs a huge responsibility and a detailed project. We heat the food, manage the bar, and rush the carts up and down the aisles. Oh and don‚Äôt forget the people with allergies or special needs! They need extra care, one wrong mistake can cost somebody a life.</p>

	      <p>Here you can see a featured flight attendant, Siti Nurazlin who works for Emirates,explains that her job requires strict qualifications like specific height, no visible tattoos, and everyone must start in economy class before moving up. Her duties are demanding, involving hours on her feet. First class attendants have extra responsibilities like memorizing menu details and tracking passenger preferences for personalized service but there are perks too like free housing in Dubai for Emirates‚Äô Cabin Crew, discounted tickets for friends and family and the best part which are layovers in cities worldwide where all accommodations and meals are covered </p>

	      <h2>A Story from My Dream Job</h2>
	      <p>This is a special story shared by JennieWeenie on Youtube! I recommend her videos :) </p>
	      <p>One special moment from someone who was working my dream job is from a YouTuber called JeenieWeenie who used to work for Emirates. On the last day of her flight, she was supposed to be on airport standby until her boss decided to send her to Johannesburg, South Africa where the 2010 FIFA World Cup was being held. She didn‚Äôt know it at first until the crew flying there got box seat tickets for every game since Emirates was the official sponsor for the World Cup. There she shared her special experiences of being a flight attendant which inspired me to become one as well in the future. </p>
